# Digital-Filter-Design
## Web Application - Written in Python (bokeh)
Custom digital filter design via zero-poles placement on z-plane and phase correction using all-pass filters.

# Features
- Placing zeros-poles on unit circle via double-clicking, and removing specific zero/pole via mouse clicking and backspace key.
- Modifying location of placed zeros-poles by dragging them.
- Clearing all placed zeros or poles.
- Adding conjugates optionality for placed zeros and poles.
- Displaying magnitude and phase responses for custom-designed filter with each change.
- Correcting phase by choosing one of the all-pass filters in an available all-pass library.
- Visualizing chosen all-pass filter through its zero-pole and phase response plots.
- Adding user-defined all-pass filter to library.
- Applying and removing user-chosen all-pass filters to custom-built digital filter.
- Applying design filter on a 1000-points signal as it is playing in cine mode (as if it is a real-time filtering process).
- Controlling speed of filtering from 1 to 1000 processed points per second via slider.
